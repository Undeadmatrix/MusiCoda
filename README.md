# Project1 -- MusiCoda

A site to aggregate information about your favorite bands and music artists.
Search for an artist and see their top tracks, a short bio, and Youtube results.

We used the Youtube API, LastFM API, and the Bands In Town API.
Our front-end framework uses Zurb Foundation libraries.

This project was the result of combined effort from Chris Little, Jordan Noe, and Danzan Ubush.
